"Oct 26, 2006 2:12 am GMT-5",aek juew (hipohin@yahoo.com),1499845827961552896,"amplitude wave\,  DOPPLER EFFECT\,  frequency of a sound wave\,  shock wave\,  sound wave\,  Wavelength",Course,English      (en),http://cnx.org/content/col10386/latest/,"AMPLITUDE:The term 'amplitude' refers to the physicalsize of an oscillation.For sound waves in air,the amplitudeis the maximum distance an individual air molecule will move from its starting point as a sound wave passes by. The amplitude of a sound wave determines its loudness. A sound wave with a large amplitude will sound louder than a small amplitude wave.      BIG BANG:The big bang theory teaches that at a specific moment, the universe began as a very small, extremely dense mass that exploded outward in a violent explosion.According to the theory, the universe is continuing to expand today as a result of this initial explosion.The observed red shift of distant stars and galaxies is one of the primary pieces of evidence for the big bang theory.      BLUE SHIFT:The change in color toward the blue end ofthe spectrum due to an object's motion toward the observer.  The blue shift is a result of the frequency of light waves coming from an object being affected by the Doppler effect. It is only noticeable when objects are moving at very high speeds.     CONSTRUCTIVE INTERFERENCE:When two waves occupy the same space at the same time, their amplitudes add.If they add to produce a wave with a larger amplitude, they are said to be interfering constructively.     DESTRUCTIVE INTERFERENCE:When two waves occupy the same space at the same time,their amplitudes add.If they tend to cancel each other out in doing so,the waves are said to be interfering destructively.       DOPPLER EFFECT:The apparent change in frequency of asound wave. The Doppler effect can be caused by the motion of the source of the sound,the motion of the observer,or by the motion of both.     DOPPLER,JOHANN CHRISTIAN:(1803-1853).Austrianphysicist and mathematician. J.C.Doppler first explainedthe Doppler effect in 1842.      DOPPLER RADAR:Radar systems often utilize the Dopplereffect to measure velocity.A light wave emitted atan object will be reflected back at a different frequency if the object is moving.The change in frequency can then be used to determine the velocity.     EINSTEIN,ALBERT:(1879-1955).German-born American physicist.Einstein produced the theories of Relativity in the early 1900's that form the basis of modern physics.  These theories gave scientists a different understanding of space and time, and also predicted the expansion of the universe.         FREQUENCY:The number of oscillations per unit time. Frequency is commonly measured in oscillations per second, or Hertz.     GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM:A network of satelliteswhich circle the globe and broadcast radio signals.Thesesignals are analyzed by GPS units on the ground to yieldinformation about position and speed.     HERTZ:The unit of measurement for frequency.One Hertz, or 1 Hz, is defined as one oscillation per second.     HERTZ,HEINRICH:(1857-1894).German physicist.      HUBBLE,EDWIN:(1889-1953).American astronomer.Hubble's observation of the Doppler effect in distant stars and galaxies help form the foundation of modern understanding of cosmology.Hubble observed that distant galaxies and stars are red shifted and therefore must be moving away from us at very high speeds.These observations are direct evidence that the universe expanding.     HUBBLE'S LAW:A mathematical principle that states thatthe velocity at which a distant star or galaxy is recedingfrom Earth is directly proportional to its distance.Therelationship is expressed in the equation v = Hod where vis the velocity of recession, Ho is the Hubble constant, andis the distance of the receding object from Earth.The precise value of the Hubble constant is not known.     INFRASONIC:Below the frequency range of human hearing;below 20 Hz.Infrasonic sounds can be produced by thunder,earthquakes and heavy machinery.     INTERFERENCE:The superposition of two waves.Whentwo or more waves meet each other, the waves combine and form a new wave.The amplitude of this new wave at any point will be the mathematical sum of the amplitudes of the original waves.     LOUDNESS:How loud a sound is as heard by the ear.The loudness of a sound wave is determined by the amplitudeof the vibration.(Loudness is commonly referred to as""volume"",although this term is sometimes avoided in this context so that sound volume is not confused with spatial volume.)       MACH NUMBER:A number indicating speed as a multiple of the speed of sound.An object moving at Mach 1 would be moving at exactly the speed of sound.Mach 2 would be a speed twice that of sound,etc.       MACH,ERNST:(1838-1916).Austrian physicist and philosopher.     MEDIUM:The material through which a wave propagates. For sound waves that we hear, the medium is commonly air.  Light,or electromagnetic radiation,is the only exampleof a wave that requires no medium through which to travel.     MODERN PHYSICS:Physics after the year 1900 is commonly known as modern physics.Based on Einstein's theories of relativity, and on the theories of quantum mechanics developed by Max Planck and Neils Bohr, modern physics replaces classical or Newtonian physics as a more current understanding of the world.      NEWTONIAN PHYSICS:Also known as ""Classical Physics.""  Newtonian physics consists of the theories ofdeveloped by Isaac Newton and those who came after him. In the late 1800's, many scientists were confident thatNewtonian physics would provide the final and nearlycomplete understanding of the world.After 1900, Newtonian physics was shown to be only a good approximation and was replaced by modern physics.      OCTAVE:A musical interval equivalent to doubling orhalving the frequency of a given note. A note that is oneoctave higher will have twice the frequency;  a note oneoctave lower will have half the frequency.     PERIOD:The time for one complete oscillation;the timefor one complete wave front to pass;  the time betweenwave emissions.Period is the inverse of frequency and iscommonly measured in seconds.     PITCH:The quality of a sound or musical note generallyreferred to as ""high"" or ""low"".A high pitched sound isproduced by a high frequency vibration.A low pitchedsound is produced by a low frequency vibration.On stringed instruments, high pitched sounds come from the shorter, smaller,and more tightly tuned strings.      RED SHIFT:The change in color toward the red end of thespectrum due to an object's motion away from an observer. The red shift is due to the Doppler effect.  It is only noticeable when an object is moving extremely fast.     RELATIVITY:The common name for the theories put forthby Albert Einstein in 1905 and 1915.The theory of relativity replaced  Newtonian mechanics and revised common notions of space and time.The General Theory of Relativity predicted the expansion of the universe.       SHOCK WAVE:The large amplitude sound wave producedby an object travelling at Mach one or faster.When anobject reaches the speed of sound,the sound waves itproduces can no longer outrun it.The sound waves ""pile up"" in the front of the object and interfere constructively toproduce one extremely large sound wave.  At Mach 1, thisshock wave is in the front of the object.At speeds greaterthan Mach 1,the shock wave takes on the shape of a conespreading out behind the object,similar to the wake behinda boat.      SONIC BOOM:The loud noise associated with a shock wave. Sonic booms are commonly caused by supersonic aircraft.  From a distance,the sonic boom sounds similar to thunder.  At close range it can be physically damaging or deafening.  Because of the inherent possibilities of damage or injury from a sonic boom, aircraft generally do not travel at speeds of Mach 1 or greater at low altitudes over populated areas.     SOUND:The propagation of molecular vibrations througha material. Sound is generally associated with wavestravelling through the air, but sound can travel through anymaterial. Any longitudinal wave passing through a materialcan properly be referred to as a sound wave.     STEADY STATE THEORY: The theory that the universeexists in a steady state, unchanging.According to thesteady state theory,the universe has always existed in itspresent condition.Although it enjoyed wide acceptance atone time,most scientists now believe that the universe hasnot existed forever but had a beginning at a specific pointin time known as the big bang.      SUBSONIC:Slower than the speed of sound.Any speedless than Mach 1 is referred to as subsonic.     SUPERSONIC:Faster than the speed of sound.Any speedgreater than Mach 1 is referred to as supersonic.     ULTRASONIC:Above the frequency range of human hearing;above 20,000 Hz.     VELOCITY:The speed at which something is moving in aparticular direction.  Velocity is commonly measured inmeters per second.  Velocity is a vector quantity andalways has a direction associated with it.       WAVE:A disturbance that propagates through a medium. Waves can occur in any material.Light,or electromagneticradiation,can travel in a vacuum and is the only example ofa wave which requires no medium through which to travel.     WAVE FRONT:One individual wave pulse,sometimesreferred to as a single wave.When used in reference tosound waves,the term generally refers to a singlecompression region of the wave.     WAVELENGTH:The distance between two consecutive wave fronts.Wavelength is commonly measured in meters and is directly related to the wave's frequency and velocity according to the equation  v = f .     YEAGER,CHUCK:American test pilot.Chuck Yeager was the first person to fly faster than sound in the experimental aircraft known as the X-1. 16",Science and Technology,http://cnx.org/content/col10386/latest/,aek juew (hipohin@yahoo.com),amplitude wave,Creative Commons Attribution License    CC-BY 2.0,"Oct 26, 2006 3:38 am GMT-5"

These m-files are included as text files in the collection New Prob m-files.We use the term m-function to designate a user-defined function as distinct from the basic MATLAB functions which are part of the MATLAB package. An m-procedure (or sometimes a procedure) is an m-file containing a set of MATLAB commands which carry out a prescribed set of operations. Generally, these will prompt for (or assume) certain data upon which the procedure is carried out. We use the term m-program (or often m-file) to refer to either an m-function or an m-procedure.Although most of the m-programs were written for MATLAB version 4.2, they work for versions 5.1, 5.2, and 7.04. The latter versions offer some new features which may make more efficient implementation of some of the m-programs, and which make possible some new ones. With one exception (so noted), these are not exploited in this collection, because of the pedagogical value of dealing with explicitly developed procedures whose dependence on basic MATLAB is displayed.These programs, with perhaps some exceptions, also run on  the MATLAB alternatives SCILAB and OCTAVE. Users of these latter programs should be able to make appropriate adjustments if needed.In addition to the m-programs there is a collection of m-files for specific problems with properly formatted data whichcan be entered into the workspace by calling the file. These m-files come from a variety of sources ( e.g., exams or problem sets, hence the odd names) and may be useful for examples and exercises.

This handbook should be used as a self-assessment instrument. The handbook is designed for use in Educational leadership classes as a part of the requirements for becoming a school administrator.   The chief school administrator should utilize the work done by the intern and then appoint a local team to review the provisions of the handbook.  Then the superintendent or chief administrator should report the results of the handbook to the local governing Board.  This handbook and any other material or follow-up materials for the handbook should be kept on file for the next 2 years.Arizona administrators who wish to stay current with Arizona laws face a daunting variety of hurdles.  Each year in the Arizona Legislature more than one thousand (1,000) bills are introduced.  Each year in the Arizona Legislature nearly three hundred (300) or more of these proposed bills relate to public education.  Each year in Arizona, sixty (60) to eighty (80) education bills are passed.  Most of these bills are located, after passage by the legislature, signature by the Governor, and review by the Attorney General,  in Arizona Revised Statutes Title 15, Education.   Many Arizona School Administrators purchase Title 15 and are fairly familiar with it.  However, a surprising number of bills that affect school administrators and public education are found in all of the forty-six (46) volumes of Arizona Revised Statutes, A.R.S. Title 1-A.R.S. Title 46.The Arizona School Law Review brings together all of these statutes that affect Arizona education together in a single volume and provides a handy self assessment for the school administrator to review a school districts policies, procedures and handbooks for compliance with Arizona School Law.  Arizona school administrators are presumed by the public and the profession to know Arizona school law.  Arizona School districts are presumed to by the public and the profession to have policies, procedures and handbooks in current compliance with Arizona School Law.  This Arizona school law review is a proven self-assessment instrument to allow a district to show that it is current in its understanding and compliance with current Arizona laws.",Social Sciences,http://cnx.org/content/col11123/latest/,Gary Emanuel (gary.emanuel@nau.edu),"Arizona Education Law Review: Gary Emanuel, Northern Arizona University",Creative Commons Attribution License    CC-BY 3.0,"Oct 9, 2009 1:17 pm GMT-5"

Each module comprises a stand alone section of an overal project of a biomedical model.ABSTRACTThere are numerous occupational and leisure tasks for which the participants are at risk of heat stress related illness. Heat stress illness effects can be either acute, such as heat stroke, heat exhaustion, heat cramps, fainting, and decline of performance; or chronic, such as loss of ability to tolerate heat, hypertension, heart muscle damage, reduced libido and impotence. Existing practices for protection against heat stress are limited to awareness education of antagonistic conditions. Persistent monitoring of individuals is not an existing practice due to a variety of factors, including drawbacks to the sensor devices and lack of quantitative definition of heat stress limits. This project presents a Bondgraph model to illustrate the body-ambient heat exchange and how it would be measured using a heat flux transducer. Individual contributions to body heat are shown as r-elements. A measurement device of a heat flux transducer is shown as a transformer element. The equation layer of the model can be tailored for various operating conditions, using either derived or empirical formulas to describe heat transfer. The model shows the same various components of body ambient heat exchange as are found in most occupation educational literature. Bondgraph figures further demonstrate causality and direction of power flow. Not fully quantified in the literature uncovered in research are how the body thermoregulatory functions begin to break down This data suggest that given a sound understanding of the heat transfer mechanisms operating with the human body during high risk tasks and environments, a heat flux transducer should provide a leading indicator of heat stress illness for any variety of tasks.",Science and Technology,http://cnx.org/content/col10530/latest/,Robert Neddermeyer (nedd0004@umn.edu),Body Ambient Bondgraph Model Using Heat Flux Transducer,Creative Commons Attribution License    CC-BY 2.0,"May 15, 2008 8:25 am GMT-5"

Teachers must now devise new strategies for teaching and the exchange of information in classrooms with a view to improving Literacy and the comprehension of English among speakers of English-based creoles.We advocate research and experimentation with digital tools as one of the ways of involving young teachers in possible projects that will challenge their own Literacy as well as that in the wider society.  THIS COLLECTION of articles was sourced on the Connexions server with precisely this aim in mind. The first article on the history of Literacy and the evolution of the  Connexions (OER)model gives us the signal that the proliferation of digital tools and their use in education will radically alter the face of teaching and learning in the coming decades. The second article explores the topic of the changing learning styles of digital learners. We are in for an educational adventure that has implications for the way Literacy can grow and be a source of enjoyment among dialect speakers of English. These articles form a framework for an exploration of how digital tools can be used to enhance Literacy on our campus.  The COLLECTION will be used for a discussion of the issues in workshops and as supplemental reading in Literacy related courses. It has evolved out of an initial exploration of the topic of technology and Literacy. One hopes that it will attract  attention and feedback from   others in the field of Literacy and the new technology.,"Humanities\,  Social Sciences",http://cnx.org/content/col10600/latest/,Barbara Joseph (cariblit1@gmail.com),A brave new digi-world and Caribbean Literacy : a search for solutions,Creative Commons Attribution License    CC-BY 2.0,"Apr 22, 2010 6:29 am GMT-5"

While many courses using this title place emphasis on applying classical philosophical and ethical theory, this course's approach is decidedly interdisciplinary and practical.  It is not designed as a socio-humanistic elective, a service philosophy course, or even an applied philosophical ethics course but as a laboratory, skills-based course where students develop, practice, and refine decision-making and problem-solving strategies that they will carry with them into the world of business practice.  Emphasis has been placed on responding to the four ethical themes identified by the AACSB ethics task force: Ethical Leadership, Ethical Decision-Making, Social Responsibility, and Corporate Governance.  Modules include (1) theory building activities (responsibility, rights, virtue), (2) problem specification frameworks emphasizing socio-technical system building and analogies with design, (3) specific modules responding to AACSB ethics themes (moral ecologies, corporate social responsibility, corporate governance, and a history of the modern corporation) and (4) modules that provide the course with a capstone, integrative experience (Business Ethics Bowl, Social Impact Statement Reports, and Corporate Ethics Compliance Officer Reports).  While a quick glance shows that this collection holds more modules than can possibly be covered in a single semester, this approach gives the user flexibility as to the method used for integrating ethics into the business administration curriculum.  Modules can be recombined into different standalone courses such as business ethics, business/government/society, or environment of organizations.  Since each module can be covered independently, they can be integrated into the business administration curriculum as specific interventions in mainstream business courses in areas like accounting, finance, management, information systems, human resources or office administration.  (In fact many have been written for and tested in these circumstances.)  Business Ethics has been developed through the NSF-funded project, ""Collaborative Development of Ethics Across the Curriculum Resources and Sharing of Best Practices,"" NSF SES 0551779.Disclaimer: We are aware that others (not us) have made (or could make) this collection/course available as printed or electronic (e.g., kindle) versions that are available online at a cost.

Giáo trình môn Cấu Trúc Dữ Liệu này được biên soạn cơ bản dựa trên quyển ""Data Structures and Algorithms"" của Alfred V. Aho, John E. Hopcroft và Jeffrey D. Ullman do Addison-Wesley tái bản năm 1987. Giáo trình này cũng được biên soạn dựa trên kinh nghiệm giảng dạy nhiều năm môn Cấu Trúc Dữ Liệu và Giải Thuật của chúng tôi.Tài liệu này được soạn theo đề cương chi tiết môn Cấu Trúc Dữ Liệu của sinh viên chuyên ngành tin học của Khoa Công Nghệ Thông Tin Trường Đại Học Cần Thơ. Mục tiêu của nó nhằm giúp các bạn sinh viên chuyên ngành có một tài liệu cô đọng dùng làm tài liệu học tập, nhưng chúng tôi cũng không loại trừ toàn bộ các đối tượng khác tham khảo. Chúng tôi nghĩ rằng các bạn sinh viên không chuyên tin và những người quan tâm tới cấu trúc dữ liệu và giải thuật sẽ tìm được trong này những điều hữu ích.Mặc dù đã rất cố gắng nhiều trong quá trình biên soạn giáo trình nhưng chắc chắn giáo trình sẽ còn nhiều thiếu sót và hạn chế.

The study of the main group elements is important for a number of reasons. On an academic level they exemplify the trends and predictions in structure and reactivity that are the key to the Periodic Table. The main group elements represent the most prevalent elements in the Earth’s crust, as well as most of the key elements of life, and have enormous industrial, economic, and environmental importance. In this regard an understanding of the chemistry of the main group elements is vital for students within science, engineering, and medicine; however, it is hoped that those who make political and economic decisions would make better ones if they had a fraction of the knowledge of the world around them. In addition to the basic synthesis, structure, properties, and reactivity of the elements and their compounds, sections describing some industrial use, as well as historical or social perspective have been added. These sections were as a result of attempts within class to put the chemistry into a context outside of the classroom.

As a result of recent governmental initiatives their is a new country-wide project to provide on-demand bone plates that are custom manufactured at on-site regional hospitals to repair long-bone fractures.   There is great pressure to keep costs contained.  You have observed that during some surgical procedures to repair/plate long-bone fractures, there is uncertainty and waste regarding the selection and use of the best bone plate.  Your job is to work with the surgeon to identify in advance of, and during the surgical procedure, the best choice for the size of the plate based on patient anthropometric data.  For this particular case, the patient is YOU!Patient data:  weight__________kgheight____________cmFor this case the bone to be plated is the tibia.  The length of the tibia is 25% of your height.  There is a small amount curvature (bowing) in the tibia that results in a 1% of body height mid-bone displacement from the vertical (and thus creating a bending moment even when just standing).  The outside diameter of the tibia at mid-length is 1.5% of body height.Your job is to select the cross-sectional dimensions of a bone plate to stabilize the fracture. You know that a realistic approach to achieving this is to select/design a bone plate whose cross-sectional dimensions result in the situation where the neutral axis is located at the interface between the plate and the bone.  As you do this, you notice that you are actually calculating Ip, and that quantity by itself does not uniquely determine both the thickness (t) and width (b) of the plate.  You use your smarts to know that you do not want the plate to protrude through the skin (requiring a relatively small thickness) and that you want the BUCMH machinist to largely be able to use relatively standard stock metal, which comes in 0.25-cm widths and thicknesses (so you may slightly be rounding up/down your dimensions).  So with this information you are able select a plate thickness and corresponding width. Second, you plan to locate the plate on the tensile side of the fracture.  Assume the installation of the plate itself results in a compressive force of one half body weight.  What degree of bending (displacement at the transverse axis of the plate kind of related to the radius of curvature) is required to assure that the fracture site remains under compression when the bone is subjected to four times body weight (in case you accidentally stumble down the stairs while you are rehabilitating).  Assume the plate length is ten times its width (while this is a reasonable value, it is not based on any engineering rationale).  For this portion of the problem you will also need to know the Young’s Modulus of the plating material (for the previous portion of the problem, you can get away with using an Ep/Eb ratio =10, I think; Eb=10x109 N/m2 and Ep=100x109 N/m2).In providing your design, use an application software package with clearly identifies inputs, units, remarks, and other documentation that explains your approach from beginning to end.  Most specifically your solution must clearly identify the dimensions you select for your plate, the degree of plate mid-point displacement (curvature).  If you correctly approach the problem but encounter unrealistic assumptions or dimensions, adjust and justify them accordingly.  Your full design report must provide full documentation so that the Chief Orthopedic Surgeon can present your results and report to the Minister of Health, whose education is in politics and not medicine or engineering.

Performance results on 2-way, 4-way and 8-way SIMD machines show that the performance scales much better than FFTW or SPIRAL.The implementations presented in this thesis are compiled into a high-performance FFT library called SFFT (``Streaming Fast Fourier Transform''), and benchmarked against FFTW, SPIRAL, Intel IPP and Apple Accelerate on sixteen x86 machines and two ARM NEON machines, and shown to be, in many cases, faster than these state of the art libraries, but without having to perform extensive machine specific calibration, thus demonstrating that there are good heuristics for predicting the performance of the FFT on SIMD microprocessors (i.e., the need for empirical optimization may be overstated).","Mathematics and Statistics\,  Science and Technology",http://cnx.org/content/col11438/latest/,Anthony Blake (amb33@cs.waikato.ac.nz),Computing the fast Fourier transform on SIMD microprocessors,Creative Commons Attribution License    CC-BY 3.0,"Jul 15, 2012 8:36 pm GMT-5"

About the title - Plato believed that emotions were wild and uncontrollable; however, Aristotle held that emotions incorporate rationality. The cognitive perspective on emotion holds that emotions are based in reality, what you feel from an event is going to be accurate – and might be separate from what you are thinking how the event felt or was. People might evaluate events and that might change their emotions based upon what they want – for instance if something isn’t going your way you will feel bad. In the first 6 chapters I discuss the relationship between thoughts and emotions, highlighting that emotions are simply your thoughts about an event only unconscious ones. I explain the role emotions have in thought and how they help motivate thoughts. I also explain what the difference is between feelings and emotions, but show how thought is tied in even with that.  In chapter 7 I show how important pleasure and pain are to emotions, how your conscious and unconscious thoughts are going to help determine what it is you are feeling (also in terms of pleasure and pain), and therefore that you can control your emotions simply by thinking properly. In chapter 8 I explain how positive emotions are processed better and easier than negative ones, which is a conscious process because you choose to process positive emotions better. In chapter 8 I show how physical feelings are mixed in with mental ones, and that shows that there is a set of feelings that isn’t determined by thought.  In more of the book I talk about depression, anger, bipolar disorder, attention, intentions, attitude, intelligence, consciousness, concentration and vision. Those topics I discuss in a way that shows how conscious reflection can change the processes (relating to the cognitive perspective on emotion because it shows how emotions can be changed by thought (and they can be because emotions function from reality (which is your thoughts and real events))).

S. adopted the same commercially-produced online courseware to teach a graduate level course in counseling theories.  The study focused on how the instructors taught the course and how they used the online resources in their teaching. The instructors faced similar challenges, but each used the technology in a different way.The data in this qualitative study came from telephone interviews that were transcribed. The data was coded by a research team using the method of Consensual Qualitative Research (Hill, Thompson, & Williams, 1997) to determine the emergent themes. The themes were reviewed by an expert in the field, as well as the participants, who all agreed that the themes resonated with their experience.  Although the course content was widely praised, the computer interface presented problems to the instructors. Faculty who taught the theories course online managed to overcome most of the barriers.  Two significant personal factors for implementing the courseware were the instructors’ stage of career and their motivation for adopting it. The online instructors, who were in the late stages of their career, used the courseware to the greatest extent. The younger instructors who were trying to obtain tenure used the courseware the least.  When faced with obstacles, the younger instructors did not persevere.    This information is relevant to institutions of higher education because enrollment in online courses is increasing more rapidly than overall enrollment (Allen & Seaman, 2007).  This study points to the need for universities to help new instructors develop their repertoire of teaching skills. Instructors’ work loads must be adjusted to allow them time on the job to get training in the use of pedagogy to use with technology, as well as use of the technology itself.  The study also points to the need to hire and develop instructors who are flexible in their approach to teaching, who are interested in learning new teaching methods, and who have the communication skills to support online learning.","Science and Technology\,  Social Sciences",http://cnx.org/content/col11130/latest/,Jeannette Dixon (jeannette.dixon@gmail.com),Faculty Use of Courseware to Teach Counseling Theories,Creative Commons Attribution License    CC-BY 3.0,"Oct 14, 2009 10:58 pm GMT-5"

It was completed in about 8 weeks as a final project for Digital Signal Processing Laboratory (ECE 420) at the University of Illinois at Urbana/Champaign. Using the latest LabView software, we were able to create an incredibly flexible OFDM transceiver that could be scaled up or down with ease. This of course is especially exciting given the prospect of cognitive radio, for which OFDM is a heavy favorite scheme of choice. With the ability to scale the number of subcarriers up and down with little impact on the receiver structure, adapting to open spectrum and conditions becomes much easier.The continuation of this project will culminate in a significant educational Connexions (CNX) module collection complete with written and visual tutorials. YouTUBE videos recorded from Camtasia Studio will close the gap between reading about the project and seeing it come together. In the end, the collection will fully detail how to implement a complete OFDM SDR system with transmitter and receiver.The final product will run on a front-end receiver utilizing National Instruments' PXI chassis populated with the 5660 digital downconverter/high-speed digitizer in conjuction with the 5671 AWG/upconverter.

What are you to make of this resource, and how might you use it in research? What are these cards, and why do they have two images?  This course explores the use, production, and cultural significance of those cards, which are called stereographs. When viewed through a device called a stereoscope, stereographs present a single, three-dimensional image.  Between the mid-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries, stereographs were the leading visual mass medium, offering detailed three-dimensional views of everything from ancient monuments to current events.   Relatively inexpensive, stereographs and stereoviewers were common in schools and middle-class homes.  Indeed, stereographs were a dominant form of photography until the 1920s and an important source of education and entertainment, touted for presenting life-like views of their subjects.  Not only does this course provide background information about stereographs, but it also examines how to use them in research projects.  Examples are provided from TIMEA (Travelers in the Middle East Archive).",Humanities,http://cnx.org/content/col10371/latest/,Lisa Spiro (lspiro@sparta.rice.edu),History through the Stereoscope: Stereoscopy and Virtual Travel,Creative Commons Attribution License    CC-BY 2.0,"Oct 30, 2006 9:04 pm US/Central"

So feelings and unconscious thought influence our conscious thought and the way we feel our emotions. Are there a few 'core' emotions that are the main contributors to our thoughts and the way we feel? Pleasure and pain might be behind our emotional drives, while more complex feelings would be the result of the other basic emotions.

The growing respectability of their productions cars (in particular the Elan) meant that a new class of customer was buying Lotus that didn’t want to be associated with the Lotus Seven. As a consequence Lotus’ founder, Colin Chapman, decided that there should be a replacement for the Seven. In addition, each Seven was loosing the company money. The result was the Series 4 (S4) Seven, which was given its own Type number (60) and was a significant departure from the bare-bones car that Seven owners had become used to. With a fiberglass body and increased interior space and comfort it was intended to broaden the sales of the Seven. This book details the development and history of the S4 Seven as well as a detailed restoration of one particular car: LBS4/2894/GT. This car left the Lotus factory in Norwich, in November 1970, configured with a 1600 cc Ford crossflow engine, a Ford standard gearbox, and was finished in red. The car was first registered in 1971, and had one owner until a fire caused significant damage from which the restoration was intended to rescue it.","Business\,  Science and Technology\,  Social Sciences",http://cnx.org/content/col11418/latest/,Andrew R.

As such, learners can access them anywhere, anytime. The course is suitable for both children and adults, Chinese and English speakers. The training pedagogy is that of the Imperial Chinese language training method, which had been used for over 2000 years to build solid language foundation. Research into how language was taught in Imperial China indicates that the elementary language education emphasized small chunks of rote-learning, model after the teacher and the elders, and practice what's learned. This course is presented in a moblog which is an effective medium for delivering small amount of knowledge anytime, anywhere. It is also effective in drilling, which enables memorization. Furthermore, its ease of publication encourages users to interact. It can also bring together mentors, parents, adult and teenage learners to share their experience, ask questions, clarify doubts, and form bonds and friendship. In this course, the core teaching materials and the communication component are accessible via wireless devices. Additional learning materials can be accessed via computers.",Humanities,http://cnx.org/content/col10286/latest/,tze Chung (tzemin@gmail.com),Learn Chinese via Mobile Phones,Creative Commons Attribution License    CC-BY 2.0,"Jun 14, 2005 11:02 pm GMT-5"

It offers a new approach to music appreciation for adults, focusing on style-independent concepts.  While the course concentrates primarily on Western classical and modern music, the concepts that are introduced apply to music of any style or era.  The goal of “Sound Reasoning” is to equip you with questions that you may ask of any piece of music, thereby creating a richer and more comprehensive understanding of music both familiar and unfamiliar.Here are some additional features of the course.•”Sound Reasoning” is completely listening based.  No ability to read music is required.•The course assumes little or no musical background.  A minimum of terminology is invoked.•Musical examples are interpolated directly into the text.•The course is interactive.  A “listening gallery” with exercises follows each module, so that you may practice and refine your listening skills.•The modules may be studied in sequence or individually.•You may easily print a .pdf of any module. “Sound Reasoning” is designed as both a stand-alone, self-paced course as well as a supplement to existing university classes.  Thanks to Connexions, “Sound Reasoning” is available free of charge twenty-four hours a day in a cross-platform format. “Sound Reasoning” was created thanks to an Access to Artistic Excellence Grant from the National Endowment for the Arts and an Innovation Grant from Rice’s Computer and Information Technology Institute.  The author wishes to thank Richard Baraniuk, the founder of Connexions; Geneva Henry, Joey King, Katie Cervenka and Elvena Mayo of the Connexions staff; and Jan Odegard and Moshe Vardi of CITI.  He wishes to extend his great gratitude to the Connexions technical team with whom he collaborated: Brent Hendricks, Scott di Pasquale, Charlet Reedstrom and Max Starkenburg.  He would especially like to thank Elizabeth Gregory of Connexions, his primary advisor  throughout the creation and implementation of the course.  He is extremely grateful for her expertise, insight and support.  The author welcomes your comments about all aspects of the course, from its contents to its ease-of-use.

Fortunately some excellent software packages exist for the automatic synthesis of impulse responses for such filters, many of them based on the now-famous Parks-McClellan algorithm. Unfortunately, there is still some mystery about how to use the software and, equally important, how to estimate impulse response lengths short of actually designing the filter itself. This technical note primarily addresses the second problem and indirectly discusses a bit the first. We examine here how to convert a typical filter specification in terms of cutoff frequency, passband ripple, etc., into a reasonably accurate estimate of the length of the impulse response. Not only does this estimate suffice for most design  tradeoff exercises, it usually allows the Parks-McClellan routines to be employed only once or twice rather than the multiple times needed when the “cut-and-try"" method is used.",Science and Technology,http://cnx.org/content/col10553/latest/,John Treichler (jrt@appsig.com),Notes on the Design of Optimal FIR Filters,Creative Commons Attribution License    CC-BY 2.0,"Sep 14, 2009 4:30 pm GMT-5"

Speck that were originally issued as separate articles in The Southern Workman. The papers, which were written early in Speck's career, during the period 1907-1911, draw upon his first-hand observations in the Indian and Oklahoma Territories on the eve of Oklahoma statehood. In contrast to his more dispassionate ethnographic writings, which were published in venues read primarily by professional anthropologists and folklorists, these essays were published for a popular audience in the journal of the Hampton Normal and Agricultural Institute, an important college serving African American and Native American students. Reflecting the sensibilities of Speck and his anthropological circle at the time, these brief essays are accessible, provocative and sometimes biting in tone and represent the work of a young scholar seeking to develop a public, progressive, critical and engaged stance relative to the social problems faced by the peoples--particularly Native American and African American peoples--of Oklahoma and of the United States more broadly. For modern readers, the essays are little utilized sources for the study of Oklahoma, Freedmen, and Muscogee (Creek) Indian cultural history. They also deepen historical understandings of Speck and his work and enrich scholarly knowledge of early efforts at developing anthropology as a means of cultural critique. Under U.S. copyright law, these essays are now in the public domain and is being republished on this basis.","Humanities\,  Social Sciences",http://cnx.org/content/col10695/latest/,"Frank G.

This is particularly important when the current trends in learning, education and training and the shifts towards what has been termed Web 2.0 approaches.  In order to better support these trends, a structured content architecture is proposed as part of the composition of SCORM 2.0 and it is argued that this approach would contribute well to solving the issues raised.  It would also enable the learning, education and training communities to both contribute to, and benefit from, single source publishing approaches.

It is important and obvious to note that ""there is no doubt that emotions and feelings are in our midst"". However, how large a background knowledge does someone need in order to navigate those feelings? Types of interpersonal relationships influence those feelings, and social interaction can be very complicated. An understanding of deep psychological factors might be needed to understand motivation in social interaction, and it might be important for high-level interactions. The psychological disorders are important, if someone is troubled then it could be useful to find a solution. Also even without those disorders someone could better themselves from understanding them because no one is completely psychologically healthy. Temperament and personality are important, they play a role in what people are like all the time, what emotions they feel all the time, and what their demeanor is all the time. That was the first paragraph in chapter 4. Below is the first 2 paragraphs in chapter 2. If social interaction was straightforward, then life wouldn't be complicated and it wouldn't take 18 years of emotional development in order to become an ""adult"". How people socially interact develops and changes throughout their lives, so there must be very complicated factors present in social situations. People can deceive, play mind games, say completely appropriate or inappropriate things, act retarded or sophisticated, be friendly or isolated - and all of those things are just a few aspects of all the psychological factors involved in social interaction. There are many things to consider that play a role in interaction. Emotion plays a role in interaction, people could be feeling one thing and presenting another emotion. Emotions determine how people feel which could change what they might say or act like. Judgements, prejudices, self-concepts and other thoughts play a role in what people are thinking and that influences behavior and the emotions that occur. What happened to the people involved leading up to the social interaction plays a role in how they are feeling and what they might say, what they did that day or the last week. Taking that further, their entire life history plays a role in who they are and what they have to talk about. Social interaction could be considered subtle and precise or it could be considered rather simple. Once a child can talk he can socially interact rather well fairly quickly. Animals and babies even know basic social skills, they know to greet people (friendly or hostile), they know the basic emotions involved and act in sophisticated ways. They can run when afraid, be happy and respond to positive input and affection, or even play simple games. Advanced social interaction could be considered much more complicated than that or not that much more complicated at all. This free book is a collection of what I consider to be the most important and useful information in psychology. For the most part the paragraphs under the bulleted information have my ideas and my explanation of why the bulleted information (other people's views and research) is important.

Educators can find suggestions for teaching sections on the early republic, the transformation of the economy and society in antebellum America, territorial expansion and Manifest Destiny, the crisis of the union and civil war, and the development of the West in the late nineteenth century. Literature teachers could use these modules to supplement sections on antebellum and seminal Civil War literary texts such as Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin and late nineteenth-century political novels and writings such as those of José Martí.

The course is taught to undergraduates, graduate students, and professional masters students and involves the areas of organizational behavior & leadership, accounting, marketing, strategy, entrepreneurship, and project management. It is this last area that is covered in this book. Irrespective of your future career in science and engineering you will be involved in projects and an awareness of the factors that enable a successful project is important for all team members. It should be recognized that the topics included in the book are not limited to scientists and engineers, they are useful for people in any careers.

Previous studies have examined technology and business cycles, as well as regional economic development and the role of collaboration in innovation. The roles of academia, industry, and the private sector within innovation systems at the national and regional levels have also received significant consideration. Through detailed study of the needs and opportunities of the Life-Science Nanotechnology Sector, it has been shown that the determining factors for success centre around the people involved and how they work together. In parallel, the study has made use of the Swansea University involvement in the Texas/United Kingdom Collaborative to explore five core components of effective and impactful collaboration, namely: People, Culture, Economics, Science and Governance.

It offers a new approach to music appreciation  for adults, focusing on style-independent concepts. While the  course concentrates primarily on Western classical and modern  music, the concepts that are introduced apply to music of any style  or era. The goal of “Sound Reasoning” is to equip you with  questions that you may ask of any piece of music, thereby creating  a richer and more comprehensive understanding of music both  familiar and unfamiliar. Here are some additional features of the  course. 1) ”Sound Reasoning” is completely listening based. No  ability to read music is required. 2) The course assumes little or  no musical background. A minimum of terminology is invoked. 3)  Musical examples are interpolated directly into the text. 4) The  course is interactive. A “listening gallery” with exercises follows  each module, so that you may practice and refine your listening  skills. 5) The modules may be studied in sequence or individually.  6)You may easily print a .pdf of any module..“Sound Reasoning” is designed as both a stand-alone, self-paced  course as well as a supplement to existing university classes.  Thanks to Connexions, “Sound Reasoning” is available free of charge  twenty-four hours a day in a cross-platform format. “Sound  Reasoning” was created thanks to an Access to Artistic Excellence  Grant from the National Endowment for the Arts and an Innovation  Grant from Rice’s Computer and Information Technology Institute.  The author wishes to thank Richard Baraniuk, the founder of  Connexions; Geneva Henry, Joey King, Katie Cervenka and Elvena Mayo  of the Connexions staff; and Jan Odegard and Moshe Vardi of CITI.  He wishes to extend his great gratitude to the Connexions technical  team with whom he collaborated: Brent Hendricks, Scott di Pasquale,  Charlet Reedstrom and Max Starkenburg. He would especially like to  thank Elizabeth Gregory  and Brian Nelson, who were his primary  technical assistants and provided invaluable support.

Brief definitions of populations, species, communities, and ecosystems are provided, with some introductory discussion of different types of ‘species concepts.’ The collection defines the terms ‘species richness’ and ‘species evenness’ as methods for measuring species diversity, and it discusses the use of species richness as a surrogate for describing overall global biodiversity. The collection reviews the distribution of biodiversity in space, explaining the definitions of alpha, beta and gamma diversity for measuring diversity within and between ecosystems. The environmental factors that affect these patterns of spatial diversity are briefly discussed. The collection also includes a brief review of the different ways by which assessments of spatial diversity are used for conservation planning and management (e.g., based on ecoregions, or biodiversity hotspots and coldspots).
